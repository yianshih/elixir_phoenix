# Fresh Equities coding challenge

This project is built in Phoenix

If you haven't run Phoenix on your machine before, follow the [installation guide](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html#content). You'll need to get Erlang, Elixir, Node, and Postgres installed.

Once they are installed, inside this project:

- Install dependencies and create the database with: `mix setup`
  - You may need to change your postgres user and password in `config/dev.exs`
- Start the Phoenix server with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
